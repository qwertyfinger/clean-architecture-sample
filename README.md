# clean-architecture-sample
Small and simple project I created a while ago showcasing usage of Clean Architecture ideas.  
And some very simple but still pretty addictive SeekBar animations.  
Presentation layer is built using the MVP pattern.

Gif recorded from AS exhibits some strange artifacts in some cases.  
In any case, it still looks much slicker on a real device :)
